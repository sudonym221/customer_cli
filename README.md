customer_cli is a terminal based customer management system . It features CRUD opertations . 
App is built on node.js and mongoDB as its database.
I used mongoose ODM, commander.js for CLI operations and inquirer.js for user's interaction with CLI.

To run the app :
$customer_cli command

Commands:
  add|a           Add a customer
  find|f name   Find a customer
  update|u _id  update a customer
  remove|r _id  Remove a customer
  list|l          List customers
  
 Use customer_cli -help for other options
